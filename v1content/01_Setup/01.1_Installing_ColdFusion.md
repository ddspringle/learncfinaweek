To be able to program in ColdFusion, a ColdFusion server needs to be
installed. There are a couple of options available, but the one that we
are going to focus on is a local development server.

A local development server is free and allows you to develop ColdFusion
applications that use all of ColdFusion's available features. There are,
however, a few limitations, such as not being able to use the server as
an external web server. That being said, there are additional benefits
to using a local ColdFusion development server, such as not needing to
have IIS or Apache installed, but instead using the packaged web server.

To install ColdFusion, follow the steps below:
