To be able to program in ColdFusion, a ColdFusion server needs to be
installed. There are a couple of options available, but the one that we
are going to focus on is a local development server.

A local development server is free and allows you to develop ColdFusion
applications that use all of ColdFusionâ€™s available features. There are,
however, a few limitations, such as not being able to use the server as
an external web server. That being said, there are additional benefits
to using a local ColdFusion development server, such as not needing to
have IIS or Apache installed, but instead using the packaged web server.

To install ColdFusion, follow the steps below:

## Windows

1. Open up a browser and go to: <https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox>
1. Download commandbox with JRE
1. find downloaded zip which should be in your downloads folder (C:\Users\username\Downloads\)
1. unzip the zip file into the downloads folder (commandbox-jre-win64-4.2.0.zip)
1. once unziped, double click on the box.exe to install -- the command prompt will appear and run through the setup
1. after install run the following commands in the command line (search for cmd to bring up command line)
     1. cfconfig
     1. bullet train
1. make a shortcut on your desktop to box.exe
1. You are now good to use CcommandBox.
1. Next install the database (1.2) and get the code from GitHub (1.3).
1. The following steps are how you spin up the site once all 3 parts are setup:
1. make sure you have downloaded the sample content code and put it into a good folder location (example: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\learncfinaweek\)
1. in the commandBox command window cd into the example content directory (example: cd c:\inetpub\wwwroot\learncfinaweek)
1. in the commandbox window type in the following: server start cfengine=adobe@2018
1. this will take some time for the site to come up. For this first spin up, you need to be connected to the internet so commandbox can find the proper ColdFusion version war file to download and install. Any time after the first spin up, CommandBox will find the war file locally and use that.
1. As the site is spinning up, CommandBox will use some included files to create your connection to the database (datasource for mariaDB and jar files for connection. These are included in the download of sample code).
1. When all this has been setup, you will see a message box in the bottom right showing the server is spinning up (it will display for a short time then disappear). After this, commandBox will open up the site in your default browser (probably IE).
1. In the future when a commandBox site is running, you can look at your system tray down by the clock and see an up arrow. Click on this and other running programs will appear. One will have the CF logo. Left click the logo and you will see the ability to open the site.
1. if all worked right, you should see a message stating the site has loaded successfully in the browser.
