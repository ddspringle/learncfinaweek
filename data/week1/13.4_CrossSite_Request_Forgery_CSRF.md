Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack which forces an end user
to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is
currently authenticated. This occurs because web browsers automatically
include most credentials with each request, such as session cookies,
basic authentication header, IP address, and client side SSL
certificates.

One of the many examples occurred with Netflix in 2006; if you used the
"Remember Me" functionality and came across any web page that had `<img
src="http://www.netflix.com/AddToQueue?movieid=70011204">`, embedded
in it, a copy of _“SpongeBob Squarepants”_ would be added to your Netflix
queue.

ColdFusion 10 introduced two new functions to deal with CSRF;
[`CSRFGenerateToken()`](https://cfdocs.org/csrfgeneratetoken) and [`CSRFVerifyToken()`](https://cfdocs.org/csrfverifytoken). To use the functions, the web
application needs to have Session Management enabled, which works by
creating a random token that can be checked when the submission occurs.

    <cfif NOT StructIsEmpty(form) >
		 <!--- your form action code --->
        <cfif NOT CSRFverifyToken(form.token)>
            <cfabort showerror="Invalid Token" />
        </cfif>

        <cfoutput><p>Hello, #EncodeForHTML(form.name)#</p></cfoutput>
    </cfif>

    <cfoutput> 
    <form method="post" name="csrfexample">
        <input name="token" type="hidden" value="#CSRFGenerateToken()#" />
        <input name="name" type="text">
        <input name="submit" type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    </cfoutput>

If there is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web
application, it is not possible to prevent CSRF since the XSS
vulnerability will allow the attacker to grab the token and include the
token with a forged request.

If the action that needs to be done is sensitive, another approach to
prevent CSRF is to force the user to re-authenticate with their password
before allowing the action to proceed.
