Configure Mail Settings
-----------------------

Before you can send emails with ColdFusion, a mail server you want to
use needs to be set. Configuring the mail server can be done in the
ColdFusion Administrator.

If you do not have a mail server of your own, your localhost can act as
a mail server. ColdFusion will act normally, but since there is no mail
server set up on your localhost, emails will not arrive at their
destination. Another option is to use the mail server of Gmail (a Gmail
account is required for this). The settings for this mail server can be
found at the end of this section.

### Mail Server Settings

In the ColdFusion Administrator, select the mail tab in the "Server
Settings". To configure the mail server, specify
the host name or IP address of the mail server in the first field. In
case the mail server requires authentication, you will need to provide a
username and password as well.

The "Verify mail server connection" option should be selected so that
you will be informed if ColdFusion finds the mail server after you saved
the settings. Do not enable this option when you use localhost as your
mail server.

The default port of a mail server is port 25. If this is not the case
for your mail server, you can provide the correct port for your mail
server.

Now that you have configured the mail server, save the settings by
clicking the "Submit Changes" button at the top right.

When you enabled the "Verify mail server connection" option, ColdFusion
will inform you if it was able to connect to the mail server. If
ColdFusion was able to connect to the mail server, you are done. If not,
review the settings or choose a different mail server.

### Gmail Mail Server Settings

-   **Mail server**: smtp.gmail.com
-   **User name**: your Gmail email address
-   **Password**: your Gmail password
-   **Enable TLS**: yes

Please note that Gmail will automatically rewrite the "from" email
address to your gmail address.

Send Email
----------

For sending emails ColdFusion provides the cfmail function. This function has three
required arguments:

-   **from**: the email address from which you want to send the email.
-   **to**: the email address to which you want to send the email.
-   **subject**: the subject of the email.

The content of the email is included within the brackets following the function call.

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion"
) {
    writeOutput("Hello, This is my first email sent with ColdFusion!");
};
~~~~

Sending a copy or a blind copy of your email to someone can be done via
the cc argument and bcc argument. Like the to argument, specify a
valid email address:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    cc="cc@domain.com",
    bcc="bcc@domain.com",
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion"
) {
    writeOutput("Hello, This is my first email sent with ColdFusion!");
};
~~~~

### Multiple Recipients

If you want the email to be sent to multiple people at once, you can
specify all email addresses as a comma-separated list in the to argument:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to01@domain.com,to02@domain.com", 
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion"
) {
    writeOutput("Hello, This is my first email sent with ColdFusion!");
};
~~~~

### HTML Email

Text emails are simple and easy, but sometimes you need more control
over the presentation of your email, such as with a newsletter or a
promotional email. What you then need is an HTML email.

Add the type argument to function and give it the value "html".
Now you can use HTML in the body of your email.:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion",
    type="html"
) {
    writeOutput("
        <html>
            <head>
                <style type='text/css'>
                body { 
                    font-family:sans-serif;
                    font-size:12px;
                    color:navy;
                }
                img {
                    width: 50px;
                }
                </style>
            </head>
            <body>
                <p>Hello,</p>
                <p>This is my first HTML email sent with ColdFusion!</p>
                <p>Email sent by <a href='http://www.coldfusion.com' ><img src='https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/mnemonics/cf_2016_appicon_RGB.svg' /></a></p>
            </body>
        </html>
    ");
};
~~~~

The email client of the recipient will render the html and display it to
the recipient.

HTML emails are very powerful, but there are two things you need to
know:

-   Not all email clients support all features of HTML; some only
    support the very basics features of HTML.
-   Not all email clients support HTML emails or the recipient disabled
    HTML emails in their email client.

In those cases, the recipient will see the source code of your HTML
email, which is not always readable.

More information on the first issue can be found at
[https://www.campaignmonitor.com/dev-resources/guides/coding-html-emails/](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/dev-resources/guides/coding-html-emails/), including tips and tricks, and a list of what's supported by which
email clients.

For the second issue, there is an easy solution: send an email with both
text and HTML.

### HTML and Text Email

The best way to make sure that the recipient of your email will receive
the right version for his email client is to send both a text and an
HTML version of the email. This can be done by adding two cfmailpart function 
calls in content of the cfmail function. The only required arguments of a cfmailpart
is the type argument that specifies which version the part
represents: "text" for the text email and "html" for the HTML email.

An optional argument for a cfmailpart function with the type set
to "text" is wraptext. This argument specifies the maximum line length,
in characters of the mail text:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion"
) {
    cfmailpart( 
        type="text", 
        wraptext="60"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            Hello,
            This is my first text and HTML email sent with ColdFusion!
            Email sent by ColdFusion
        ");
    };
    cfmailpart( 
        type="html"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style type='text/css'>
                    body { 
                        font-family:sans-serif;
                        font-size:12px;
                        color:navy;
                    }
                    img {
                        width: 50px;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
                    <p>This is my first HTML email sent with ColdFusion!</p>
                    <p>Email sent by <a href='http://www.coldfusion.com' ><img src='https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/mnemonics/cf_2016_appicon_RGB.svg' /></a></p>
                </body>
            </html>
        ");
    };
};
~~~~

### Adding Attachments

By adding a cfmailparam function in content of the cfmail function, you can add
attachments to your email:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    subject="Q1 Financial Results"
) {
    cfmailpart( 
        type="text", 
        wraptext="60"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            Dear,
            In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.
            Email sent by ColdFusion
        ");
    };
    cfmailpart( 
        type="html"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style type='text/css'>
                    body { 
                        font-family:sans-serif;
                        font-size:12px;
                        color:navy;
                    }
                    img {
                        width: 50px;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
                    <p>In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.</p>
                    <p>Email sent by <a href='http://www.coldfusion.com' ><img src='https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/mnemonics/cf_2016_appicon_RGB.svg' /></a></p>
                </body>
            </html>
        ");
    };
    cfmailparam(
        file="Q1FinancialResults.pdf", 
        type="text/plain", 
        remove=false
    );
};~~~~

Through the optional type argument, you can indicate what the MIME
media type of the attachment is; with the optional disposition
argument, you can indicate if you want the attachment to be presented
inline ("inline") or as an attachment ("attachment"):

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    subject="Q1 Financial Results"
) {
    cfmailpart( 
        type="text", 
        wraptext="60"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            Dear,
            In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.
            Email sent by ColdFusion
        ");
    };
    cfmailpart( 
        type="html"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style type='text/css'>
                    body { 
                        font-family:sans-serif;
                        font-size:12px;
                        color:navy;
                    }
                    img {
                        width: 50px;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
                    <p>In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.</p>

        ");
    };
    cfmailparam(
        file="Q1FinancialResults.pdf", 
        type="text/plain", 
        remove=false, 
        disposition="attachment"
    );
};

### Send Bulk Emails

When you want to send an email to a lot of people, using the to
attribute of the cfmail function is not recommended. Several mail clients and
mail servers will mark the message a SPAM when sending it to a large
quantity of people; you may also not want to share the list of email
addresses with your recipients.

By providing the cfmail function with a query result that contains the email
addresses, every recipient will receive a personal email:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
getList = QueryNew("email", "VarChar", [
    {email="ben.forta@domain.com"},
    {email="ben.nadel@domain.com"},
    {email="raymond.camden@domain.com"}
]);

cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="#email#", 
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion",
    query="getList"
) {
    cfmailpart( 
        type="text", 
        wraptext="60"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            Dear,
            In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.
            Email sent by ColdFusion
        ");
    };
    cfmailpart( 
        type="html"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style type='text/css'>
                    body { 
                        font-family:sans-serif;
                        font-size:12px;
                        color:navy;
                    }
                    img {
                        width: 50px;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
                    <p>In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.</p>
                    <p>Email sent by <a href='http://www.coldfusion.com' ><img src='https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/mnemonics/cf_2016_appicon_RGB.svg' /></a></p>
                </body>
            </html>
        ");
    };
    cfmailparam(
        file="Q1FinancialResults.pdf", 
        type="text/plain", 
        remove=false, 
        disposition="attachment"
    );
};
~~~~

You can personalize the email even more by passing additional
information to the cfmail function through the query result:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
getList = QueryNew("firstname,lastname,email", "VarChar,VarChar,VarChar", [
    {firstname="Ben", lastname="Forta", email="ben.forta@domain.com"},
    {firstname="Ben", lastname="Nadel", email="ben.nadel@domain.com"},
    {firstname="Raymond", lastname="Camden", email="raymond.camden@domain.com"}
]);

cfmail(
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="#email#", 
    subject="My first email sent with ColdFusion",
    query="getList"
) {
    cfmailpart( 
        type="text", 
        wraptext="60"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            Dear,
            In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.
            Email sent by ColdFusion
        ");
    };
    cfmailpart( 
        type="html"
    ) {
        writeOutput("
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style type='text/css'>
                    body { 
                        font-family:sans-serif;
                        font-size:12px;
                        color:navy;
                    }
                    img {
                        width: 50px;
                    }
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>Dear #firstname# #lastname#,</p>
                    <p>In attachment you will find the financial results of Q1.</p>

                </body>
            </html>
        ");
    };
    cfmailparam(
        file="Q1FinancialResults.pdf", 
        type="text/plain", 
        remove=false, 
        disposition="attachment"
    );
};
~~~~

View Undelivered Mail
---------------------

ColdFusion saves a copy of all undelivered emails in a special folder
([CF root]/Mail/undelivr/). The ColdFusion Administrator has an
interface to this folder for easier browsing. To view the undelivered
emails, open the ColdFusion Administrator. In the left menu, below
"Server Settings", you will find "Mail". In the "Mail Spool Settings"
section, click the "View Undelivered Mail" button.

This page displays a list of all undelivered email. You can delete these
emails through the "delete" button, or resend them using the "respool"
button.

Overwrite Default Mail Server Settings
--------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to use a different mail server than the one set
up in the ColdFusion Administrator, or perhaps you don't have access to
the ColdFusion Administrator. In these situations, you can specify the
mail server settings directly in the cfmail function through the server
argument, port argument, username argument, and password argument:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
cfmail(
    server="localhost", 
    port="25", 
    username="", 
    password="", 
    from="from@domain.com", 
    to="to@domain.com", 
    subject="An email sent with an alternative mail server"
) {
    writeOutput("
        Hello,
        This is an email sent with an alternative mail server!
    ");
};
~~~~
