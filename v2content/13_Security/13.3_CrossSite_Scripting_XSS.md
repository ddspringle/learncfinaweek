Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is the most prevalent web application
security flaw and occurs when user supplied data is sent to the browser
without properly validating or escaping that content. XSS flaws can
allow the attacker to:

-   Deface web page (examples [http://xssed.com](http://xssed.com),
    [http://www.alpacahack.com/](http://www.alpacahack.com/))
-   Steal session cookies so attackers can impersonate victims without
    having to steal passwords
-   Spoof login prompts to steal passwords
-   Keystroke logging
-   Redirect user to malware site
-   Total takeover of end user through tools like BeEF ([Browser
    Exploitation
    Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeEF_(Browser_Exploitation_Framework)))

There are three types of XSS:

-   **Reflected**
     Reflected attacks are where the injected code is sent as part of
    the request and shown in the response. Common locations for
    reflected XSS are in error messages or search results. Reflected
    attacks require getting the user to click on the specially crafted
    URL or form with the injection. They are usually embedded in
    phishing emails or hidden through URL shorteners. Reflected XSS is
    also referred to as first order XSS.
-   **Stored**
     Stored attacks are where the injected code is permanently stored in
    the web application. Common locations for stored XSS are in message
    forums, blog comments, or comment fields. The stored attack is sent
    to the user when they access the information. Stored XSS is also
    referred to as Persistent or second order XSS.
-   **DOM Based**
     As the name suggests, the DOM based attack directly manipulates the
    browser through the DOM. DOM based attacks are different in that the
    response from the server is not manipulated, but the client side
    scripting is manipulated to modify how it runs.

Dealing with XSS requires properly decoding the input, validating the
input, and then encoding the input for the context it will be used.

How Many Ways to Encode \< as an HTML Entity?
---------------------------------------------

So how many ways can you think of? Probably, `&lt;` maybe `&\#60;`. There
are actually 68 variations when using UTF-8. The problem only gets worse
when attackers encode a string multiple times and mix the encodings to
bypass validation filters. Below are some examples of how `<` can be
encoded using different techniques:

-   **`&lt;`** - double encoding
-   **`%26lt%3b`** - double encoding with multiple schemes
-   **`%252525253C`** - multiple encoding
-   **`&%6ct;`** - nested encoding with multiple schemes

It becomes very clear that trying to create black lists of patterns is
futile when script can be encoded 1,677,721,600,000,000 ways. ColdFusion
10 introduced a new function, [`Canonicalize()`](https://cfdocs.org/canonicalize), which reduces an encoded
string down to its simplest form. `Canonicalize` takes three arguments;
the first is the string to be processed, the next is a boolean to
indicate whether multiple encodings should be restricted, and the third
is another boolean to indicate whether mixed encodings should be
restricted. If either of the boolean flags are set to true, ColdFusion
will throw an error if the string contains a given restriction. Input
that is encoded multiple times and/or contains mixed encodings is
something a normal user would not do and should be regarded as an attack
on the web application.

Below is an example function that will canonicalize all the keys of a
structure, blocking any input that contains multiple or mixed encodings
and logging them.

    
	public void function decodeScope(required struct scope) output=false {
		var key = "";
		for ( key in arguments.scope ) {
			if ( IsSimpleValue(arguments.scope[key]) ) {
				try {
					//  do not allow multiple and mixed encodings, most likely an attack 
					arguments.scope[key] = canonicalize(arguments.scope[key], true, true);
				} catch (any cfcatch) {
					/*  if logging actual string, encoded it properly for context. 
	                      Truncating cfcatch.logmessage so value is not included */
					cflog( text=key# - #Left(cfcatch.LogMessage, Find(' in', cfcatch.LogMessage)), application=true, file="encodingErrors", type="error" );
					arguments.scope[key] = "";
				}
			}
		}
	}
	decodeScope(url);
	decodeScope(form);
	decodeScope(cookie);
	decodeScope(cgi);

Canonicalize makes it easier to do validation now that the input has the
encoding simplified. Do not output any values that have been
canonicalized without properly encoding them for context which they will
be used.

Validation
----------

Now that the input has been canonicalized, it needs to be validated. As
stated before, the best approach is for a white list, where you only
allow good known patterns of the input through; anything that does not
match the pattern is rejected. ColdFusion's [`IsValid()`](https://cfdocs.org/isvalid) is the best choice
since it has many predefined types and the ability to use regular
expressions. The input should be checked for length and if it is in a
valid range in the case of drop-downs, radio buttons, and checkboxes
using values from the database.

    
    // IsValid using pre-defined type for US Zip Code
    if (NOT IsValid("zipcode", form.zipcode)) {
        variables.error += "Bad Zip Code<br />";
    }

    // IsValid using regex
    if (NOT IsValid("regex", form.zipcode, "^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$")) {
        variables.error += "Bad Zip Code<br />";
    }

    // Another IsValid using regex limiting characters (only alphanumeric, space, ., -, ', and ,)
    if (NOT IsValid("regex", form.address, "^[a-zA-Z0-9 \.\-,']+$")) {
        variables.error += "Bad Address<br />";
    }
    

There are also many validation functions available through
[CFLib](http://cflib.org/). Validation should always take place on the
server side. Client side validation should not be relied upon since it
can be circumvented.

### What About Rich Text Editors?

Inevitably, there will be a requirement for the web application to
accept rich text formatting in textarea, which involves accepting HTML
markup; this can be dangerous because it is harder to filter XSS. If
possible, only accept rich text from users that are logged in to the web
application. Filtering HTML used for rich text is difficult, and it is
recommend to use [OWASP
AntiSamy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project)
instead of trying to create your own filters. There are several blog
postings on how to integrate AntiSamy with ColdFusion; the best one is
by Pete Freitag, [Using AntiSamy with
ColdFusion](http://www.petefreitag.com/item/760.cfm).

Another approach would be to use something other than HTML to markup the
content. There are several lightweight markup languages such as
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
[BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode), or various wiki text
formats which could be used. It is a little more complex to implement,
but since the web applications are directly controlling the formatting
and rendering of the markup, it becomes significantly harder to
introduce XSS to the content.

Proper Encoding for Output
--------------------------

Now that the input has been canonicalized and validated, is it safe to
use it? Actually, the answer is no; it is still possible that the
validation let something through, as attackers are always finding new
ways to create XSS attacks. Any input that is used after it has been
canonicalized and validated needs to be encoded for the context it will
be used in to ensure that it is not interpreted to be anything other
than text. In previous versions of ColdFusion, one would use
HTMLEditFormat(), XMLFormat(), or URLEncodedFormat(), but they do not
properly encode everything correctly if you are using the input in
Javascript or CSS. ColdFusion 10 introduced several functions using the
OWASP ESAPI library which addressed these shortcomings.

  
| Context          | Function                   | Example
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -----------------------
| HTML             | `EncodeForHTML()`          | `<p>Hello #EncodeForHTML(url.name)#</p>`
| HTML Attribute   | `EncodeForHTMLAttribute()` | `<div id="#EncodeForHTMLAttribute(url.name)#">`
| Javascript       | `EncodeForJavascript()`    | `<a onclick="welcome('#EncodeForJavascript(url.name)#');">` or `<script>var name = #EncodeForJavascript(url.name)#;</script>`
|  CSS             | `EncodeForCSS()`           |  `<div style="background-color: \#EncodeForCSS(url.color)\#;"\>\</div\>` or `<style>.customColor {background-color: #EncodeForCSS(url.color)#};</style>`
| URL              | `EncodeForURL()`           |  `<a href="http://www.example.com/edit.cfm?id=#EncodeForURL(url.id)#">Edit\</a>`
| XML              | `EncodeForXML()`           |  `<userinfo><name>#EncodeForXML(url.name)#</name></userinfo>`




Because the older functions like `HTMLEditFormat`, `URLDecode`,
`URLEncodedFormat`, and `XMLFormat` do not encode and decode as well as the
new functions based upon ESAPI, Adobe is likely to deprecate them in
favor of the newer functions.

        <input type="submit" />
    </form>

Older Versions of ColdFusion
----------------------------

As seen above, older functions that were relied upon to properly encode
and decode data do not work as well as the new ESAPI based functions in
ColdFusion 10. If ColdFusion 8 or 9 has been patched with APSB11-04 or
higher, the ESAPI Java library can be used by calling the Java library.
There is another excellent blog post by Pete Freitag, [ColdFusion's
Built in Enterprise Security
API](http://www.petefreitag.com/item/788.cfm); here, he addresses the
method that [CFBackport](https://github.com/misterdai/cfbackport#readme)
uses and provides the same encode functionality for ColdFusion 8 and 9
along with other functions introduced in ColdFusion 10. Another
alternative would be to use
[CFESAPI](https://github.com/damonmiller/cfesapi#readme), which is a
full implementation of ESAPI in ColdFusion.
