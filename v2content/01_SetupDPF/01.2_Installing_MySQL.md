ColdFusion has the ability to communicate with a number of different
databases, which will be covered later on in this course; for the sample
application we will be working on throughout the course, we will be
using MySQL. If you already have MySQL 4 or 5 already installed, you can
proceed to the 'Install Sample Files' section. If not, follow the steps
